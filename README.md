# Overview
This repository contains materials related to a Kaggle competition focused on predicting house prices. The goal of the competition is to develop models that accurately predict the sales prices for houses based on various features. The provided datasets include training and test datasets, a sample submission file, and a Jupyter notebook (house_price_prediction.ipynb) showcasing the data analysis and prediction models.

# Files in the Repository
train.csv: The training dataset containing features and corresponding sale prices for houses.
test.csv: The test dataset without sale prices, used for making predictions.
sample_submission.csv: A sample submission file indicating the required format for submitting predictions.
house_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing data exploration, analysis, and prediction models for the house price prediction competition.
Kaggle Competition Description

# Goal
The goal of the competition is to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, participants must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

# Data Description
The dataset contains various features related to residential properties, and the target variable is the sale price. Participants are required to develop predictive models based on the training dataset and apply them to the test dataset to make predictions.

# Note
The Jupyter notebook provides insights into the data and offers a foundation for developing predictive models.
Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the provided materials for your participation in the Kaggle competition. If you have any questions or encounter issues, consider referring to the Kaggle competition forums for support.

Good luck with your house price prediction journey! üè°üí∞
